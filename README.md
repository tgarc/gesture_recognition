Code for classifying hand gestures from the libras dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Libras+Movement dataset

My attempt at putting together a classifier for recognizing 2D gestures from the libras dataset. 
Once I get some satisfying results I'll also be writing code to actually do hand segmentation from a video stream to record my own gestures.
